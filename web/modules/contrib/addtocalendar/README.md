addtocalendar.com which supports iCalender, Google Calendar, Outlook, 
Outlook Online and Yahoo Calendar. It's basically a thirdparty field
formatter setting available for Datetime and Datetime Range field formatters.

Module internally extends Datetime and Datetime Range field formatters using third party
settings to append the "Add to Calendar" button besides date field.
If the date field is multivalued than its configurable to show the button beside
particular date field or for all.
When clicked on this button, the event is exported to the corresponding
website with proper information in the next tab where user can add the 
event to their calendar.
